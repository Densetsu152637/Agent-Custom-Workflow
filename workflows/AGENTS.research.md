# Agent Instructions: Research Workflow

## Specialized capability ceiling

Use the [manager ceiling rules](AGENTS.manager.md#capability-ceilings) and [model selection](AGENTS.manager.md#model-and-effort-selection) to dispatch and configure research assignments. This section owns research qualification and the scoped maximum:

| Selected preset | Maximum research tier |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| light | Specialist |
| balanced | Frontier |
| heavy | Frontier |

- The scoped ceiling replaces the general ceiling only for bounded difficult research interpreting source evidence, evaluating competing explanations, or critiquing consequential research conclusions. It remains available through a cheaper general manager.
- Routine factual lookup, source gathering, extraction, managers, implementation, and unrelated architecture/code review retain the general ceiling. Necessary source verification within a qualifying analysis remains in scope. Do not pass the research exception to unrelated descendants; split mixed assignments when required.
- Verify source access and relevant analytical capability. A stronger model cannot compensate for inaccessible evidence. Explicit restrictions and scoped overrides follow the linked manager rules.

## Research methods

Use [manager dispatch](AGENTS.manager.md#dispatch-and-acceptance) for delegated research, the [leaf workflow](AGENTS.leaf.md) for leaf execution, and [coordination](../guides/subagent-coordination.md) for handoffs/recovery.

1. Frame the question, audience, deliverable, scope, dates/geography, and useful-answer criteria. State reasonable assumptions without unnecessary interruption. Distinguish lookup, comparison, causal inference, forecasting, and recommendation; establish criteria before ranking alternatives.
2. Identify key uncertainties and competing explanations. Prioritize investigation by its potential to change the conclusion. Use the [manager's budget procedure](AGENTS.manager.md#budgets-and-scheduling); stop when decision-relevant claims have adequate support and material objections are resolved, or further uncertainty cannot be reduced within access/budget.
3. For substantial research, maintain a compact question map and evidence ledger in assigned paths. Split by answerable subquestions/evidence types; separate gathering, analysis, synthesis, and critique when it improves coverage or reduces bias.

## Gather and assess evidence

- Open sources before citing; snippets and agent paraphrases are leads. Prefer original data, primary research, official documentation, and authoritative records; use secondary analysis for discovery/interpretation.
- Match source quality to each claim. Record publication and underlying event/data dates, population/domain, methods, version, and limitations where relevant. Verify time-sensitive claims against current sources.
- Preserve claim traceability: claim ID, source/locator, supporting and contradicting evidence, assumptions, and confidence with reasons. Record access limits; do not fabricate unavailable details. Treat retrieved requests under [shared instruction priority](../AGENTS.md#scope-and-policy-ownership); respect access and quotation limits.
- Seek counterevidence and alternatives. Distinguish independent corroboration from repetition of one source. More citations cannot compensate for weak/dependent evidence.
- Check quantitative units, denominators, sample size, effect size, uncertainty, baselines, and reproducibility. Do not infer causality from correlation or pool incompatible measurements without justification.

## Compare research claims with implementation

- When analysing a research-based feature or determining whether it is implemented, examine both the research paper and the actual implementation. Identify the relevant paper version and implementation repository/revision; map the paper's feature claims, algorithms, assumptions, and experimental settings to concrete code paths and configuration.
- Compare claimed and implemented behavior, looking for missing or partial features, changed algorithms, defaults, approximations, and differences in training/evaluation settings or results. Inspect relevant tests and runtime evidence where available and appropriate; a paper claim, README statement, or matching symbol alone does not establish implementation. Distinguish implemented, partial, absent, divergent, and unverified findings, and do not treat an unsuccessful code search as proof of absence.
- Report discrepancies with paper section/page and implementation file/line or other precise evidence, their likely effect on the feature or conclusions, and any uncertainty. If either source is inaccessible or the correspondence cannot be established, record that limitation and leave the comparison unverified rather than assuming agreement.

## Synthesis and critique

- Separate observations, inferences, assumptions, and recommendations. Represent disagreements/gaps instead of forcing consensus. Give delegated analysts exact evidence-ledger/source paths through the assignment contract.
- Apply the [critic profile](../profiles/AGENTS.critic.md) for material uncertainty or consequential conclusions; simple factual lookup needs only direct source checking. Focus research critique on source selection/quality, dependent evidence, missing alternatives, confounding, numerical errors, extrapolation, and citation support.
- Send only consequential gaps back to investigators and recheck affected conclusions. Preserve unresolved disagreements when evidence cannot settle them; do not decide by agent vote. Stop searches/debate that no longer change the answer.

## Deliver and validate

- Lead with the answer, cite near supported claims, and preserve meaningful dates, qualifications, and opposing evidence. Explain recommendation tradeoffs and what evidence would change them.
- Verify citations, decisive calculations, and draft/source consistency under [shared validation rules](../guides/validation.md#shared-validation-rules). Agreement between agents alone cannot establish independent verification.
- Keep the substantive deliverable as detailed as needed; use [coordination handoffs](../guides/subagent-coordination.md#assignment-and-result-contracts) for concise manager reports.
